# Contributing

This is an upstream fork of [meew0/discordcr](https://github.com/meew0/discordcr).
I'm maintaining this fork now as the number of the features I needed and
developed for the library have taken some time to get merged, and this is
an easier method to manage patches. I've moved this to my public repo so
that others can also easily use these features they may have been waiting for.

That said, I do not intend for this repo to diverge or otherwise replace
meew0's original repo. I still support his projects, so to those using this fork
there are some conditions I'd like to lay out for getting your things merged
here in my fork:

1. PR your fixes and features to [meew0/discordcr](https://github.com/meew0/discordcr)
2. If they are approved, I will cherry-pick them here when I can.

- Do not open issues or pull requests to this repo that otherwise belong on the
original repo. Only upstream-meta issues should be reported here (CI, missing
commits).
- When meew0's repo starts merging again, I will decide then on what will
happen with this fork.
- Until further notice, I won't be issuing any releases/tags. If you are going
to use this fork, I recommend watching the repo and updating your dependency
at your own discretion. Pin to a commit if you don't want to pull breaking
changes.

If you are unsure about any of the above or have any questions, please feel
free to message me on Discord: `z64#1337`
